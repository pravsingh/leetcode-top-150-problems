/**
 * 37. Sudoku Solver
 *
 * Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],...]
 * Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],...]

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use appropriate array manipulation technique
 * - Consider sorting, two pointers, or sliding window
 * - Handle edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Optimize for time and space complexity
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all combinations
 * 2. Sorting: O(n log n) - Sort first, then process
 * 3. Hash-based: O(n) - Use HashMap/HashSet for lookups
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose the right data structure for the problem
 * - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
 * - Look for patterns that can be optimized
