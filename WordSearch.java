/**
 * 79. Word Search
 *
 * Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
 * Output: true

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use appropriate array manipulation technique
 * - Consider sorting, two pointers, or sliding window
 * - Handle edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Optimize for time and space complexity
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all combinations
 * 2. Sorting: O(n log n) - Sort first, then process
 * 3. Hash-based: O(n) - Use HashMap/HashSet for lookups
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose the right data structure for the problem
 * - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
 * - Look for patterns that can be optimized
