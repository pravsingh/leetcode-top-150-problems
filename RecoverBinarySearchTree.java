/**
 * 99. Recover Binary Search Tree
 *
 * You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
 * Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
 * Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use tree traversal techniques (DFS/BFS)
 * - Consider recursive or iterative approaches
 * - Handle edge cases like null nodes or single nodes
 * - Use appropriate data structures for level-order traversal
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) where n is number of nodes
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(h) to O(n) where h is height
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Recursive DFS: O(n) time, O(h) space - Use recursion
 * 2. Iterative DFS: O(n) time, O(h) space - Use stack
 * 3. BFS: O(n) time, O(w) space - Use queue for level-order
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose traversal order based on problem requirements
 * - Consider space complexity of recursion vs iteration
 * - Handle null nodes and edge cases carefully
