 * 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
 *
 * Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
 * Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
 * Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use appropriate array manipulation technique
 * - Consider sorting, two pointers, or sliding window
 * - Handle edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Optimize for time and space complexity
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all combinations
 * 2. Sorting: O(n log n) - Sort first, then process
 * 3. Hash-based: O(n) - Use HashMap/HashSet for lookups
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose the right data structure for the problem
 * - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
 * - Look for patterns that can be optimized
