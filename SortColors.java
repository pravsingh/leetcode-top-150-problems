/**
 * 75. Sort Colors
 *
 * Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,0,1]
 * Output: [0,1,2]

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use appropriate array manipulation technique
 * - Consider sorting, two pointers, or sliding window
 * - Handle edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Optimize for time and space complexity
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all combinations
 * 2. Sorting: O(n log n) - Sort first, then process
 * 3. Hash-based: O(n) - Use HashMap/HashSet for lookups
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose the right data structure for the problem
 * - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
 * - Look for patterns that can be optimized
