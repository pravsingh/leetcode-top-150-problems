/**
 * 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
 *
 * Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
 * Output: -1

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use string manipulation techniques
 * - Consider character counting, pattern matching, or parsing
 * - Handle edge cases like empty strings or special characters
 * - Use appropriate string methods efficiently
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all substrings
 * 2. Regular Expressions: O(n) - Use regex for pattern matching
 * 3. Character counting: O(n) - Count character frequencies
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - String operations can be optimized with appropriate data structures
 * - Consider character encoding and special cases
 * - Look for patterns that can be exploited
