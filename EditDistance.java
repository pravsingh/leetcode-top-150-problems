/**
 * 72. Edit Distance
 *
 * Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
 * Output: 5

 *
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * - Use appropriate array manipulation technique
 * - Consider sorting, two pointers, or sliding window
 * - Handle edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Optimize for time and space complexity
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(n) to O(n²)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: Varies based on approach - typically O(1) to O(n)
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * 1. Brute Force: O(n²) or higher - Check all combinations
 * 2. Sorting: O(n log n) - Sort first, then process
 * 3. Hash-based: O(n) - Use HashMap/HashSet for lookups
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Choose the right data structure for the problem
 * - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
 * - Look for patterns that can be optimized
